Sure! Let’s break this module down carefully. I’ll go **field by field** and function by function so you clearly see what’s going on.

# **Module:** `Util.Network.AdaptivePingPong`

### **Purpose**

* Handles network-level ping/pong for a device in a GenServer.
* Tracks device health (missed pongs, RTT, state).
* Dynamically adjusts ping intervals based on network latency.
* Triggers online/offline state changes to the server.
* Fan-out awareness or ping-pong updates for other components.

# **Key Fields in the GenServer state**

| Field                         | Type / Default | Purpose                                                                               |

| `device_state.last_activity`  | DateTime       | Last user activity, can differ from ping/pong                                         |

# **Core Functions**

### **1. `handle_ping/1`**

* Called periodically to check device liveness.
* Calculates `delta` = current time − `last_ping`.
* Checks three conditions:

1. **Ping delayed:**

   * If `delta > max_allowed_delay`, the GenServer terminates because the ping is too delayed.

2. **Missed too many pongs:**

   * If `missed_pongs >= max_missed`, triggers `state_change` to `OFFLINE` and schedules next ping.

3. **Normal ping:**

   * Sends a ping to `ws_pid`.
   * Schedules next ping.
   * Calls `handle_increment_counter/7` to increment pong counters and possibly refresh ONLINE state.

---

### **2. `handle_increment_counter/7`**

* Increments the ping counter.
* Calls `increment_counter/5`:

```elixir
if counter + 1 >= @max_pong_counter -> reset counter, ONLINE state refresh
else -> increment counter
```

* Updates `state` with new counters, last RTT, and last send ping time.

---

### **3. `state_change/5`**

* Handles device state transitions.
* Inputs: `device_id`, `eid`, `status` (ONLINE/OFFLINE), last_state_change, GenServer `state`.
* Uses `DeviceState.track_state_change/2` to determine if the state really changed.
* Returns either:

```elixir
{:chr, new_state}   # state changed
{:unchr, same_state} # unchanged
```

* Sends updated state to **Bimip server master** via `RegistryHub.send_pong_to_bimip_server_master/3`.

**Fields used in tracking:**

* `last_seen`: updated on ping/pong
* `last_activity`: updated on intentional activity
* `awareness_intention`: optional, default = 2 (used for notifications)

---

### **4. `calculate_adaptive_interval/1` & `maybe_adaptive_interval/1`**

* Dynamically adjust the next ping interval based on RTT:

| RTT        | Interval               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| High RTT   | `intervals.high_rtt`   |
| Medium RTT | `intervals.medium_rtt` |
| Low RTT    | `intervals.default`    |

* Prevents network congestion and adapts to latency.

---

### **5. `maybe_adaptive_max_missed/1`**

* Dynamically adjusts maximum missed pongs allowed depending on RTT.
* High RTT → higher tolerance for missed pongs.
* Low RTT → fewer allowed misses.

---

### **6. `schedule_ping/2`**

* Calls `RegistryHub.schedule_ping_registry/2` to schedule next ping with adaptive interval.
* Uses `last_rtt` if available.

---

### **7. `pongs_received/3`**

* Handles pongs received from client.
* Calculates RTT from `last_send_ping`.
* Resets `missed_pongs` to 0.
* Updates `pong_counter`.
* Calls `state_change` if counter reaches max → refresh ONLINE.

---

### **8. `handle_pong_from_network/2`**

* Handles network-level pong (not from client directly).
* Calls `RegistryHub.handle_pong_registry/2`.
* Useful for network-level monitoring (middlebox, NAT, etc.).

---

# **Flow Summary**

1. **Ping sent → client responds with pong.**
2. **Missed pong counter increments → if too many → OFFLINE**
3. **Pong received → reset missed counter → possibly refresh ONLINE**
4. **RTT measured → adaptive ping interval and max_missed**
5. **State changes (ONLINE/OFFLINE) pushed to server (RegistryHub / Bimip)**

---

# **Important Notes**

* `ping_counter` vs `missed_pongs`:

  * `missed_pongs` tracks consecutive failed pings → offline detection
  * `pong_counter` tracks total pings → refresh ONLINE state when limit reached

* **Intentional user states** (AWAY, DND, etc.) are **not overridden by ping-pong**, only ONLINE/OFFLINE.

* `device_state` keeps the authoritative state **per device**, replacing ETS.

* This module integrates closely with **SubscriberPresence / Awareness** for notifications.

If you want, I can **draw a clear diagram of Ping-Pong flow vs Awareness flow**, showing how `last_seen`, `state_change`, and notifications interact. That makes it really easy to see potential issues like double notifications.

Do you want me to do that next?
