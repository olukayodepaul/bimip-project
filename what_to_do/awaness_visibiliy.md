## ‚úÖ **Full Awareness Visibility Workflow**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **User toggles awareness visibility**

- A user on one device (say device A) sends:
  `AwarenessVisibility { id, from, type = 1 or 2 }`
- This message goes **from bimipSignal ‚Üí bimipServer**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **bimipServer updates the user‚Äôs visibility state**

- `bimipServer` stores the **new state** (ENABLED or DISABLED) for that user.
- This becomes the **source of truth** for all devices and all future sessions.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **bimipServer broadcasts the visibility change to all user devices**

- Send a **ThrowAwarenessVisibilitySchema.success()** message to:

  - the **origin device** (acknowledgement),

  - and all **other devices** of the same user (synchronization).

  > üî∏ All user devices will now reflect the same visibility state.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **bimipSignal updates local broadcast behavior**

Each device‚Äôs `bimipSignal` instance now:

- **Disables awareness signals** if `type = 2 (DISABLED)` ‚Üí stops sending `ONLINE`, `TYPING`, `READ`, etc.
- **Re-enables awareness signals** if `type = 1 (ENABLED)` ‚Üí resumes normal broadcast.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **bimipServer updates shared awareness state for new sessions**

- When the user **logs in again (new session)**, `bimipServer` includes the **current visibility state** in the login response.
  That ensures the new session immediately obeys the same rule.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **(Optional but Recommended)** ‚Äî **Server notifies contacts (roster) if visibility changes**

If you want to make it more interactive:

- When a user disables visibility (`DISABLED`), server can send a **‚Äúpresence offline‚Äù** update to the user‚Äôs contacts.
- When re-enabled, it can send a **‚Äúpresence online‚Äù** update again.

_(This step depends on your product‚Äôs privacy policy ‚Äî some systems don‚Äôt notify contacts when visibility changes.)_

### üîπ Summary of Responsibilities

| Component                     | Responsibility                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bimipSignal (client node)** | Sends visibility toggle request and updates local behavior.                   |
| **bimipServer**               | Maintains global truth of user visibility, broadcasts updates to all devices. |
| **All user devices**          | Mirror visibility state and adjust broadcast behavior accordingly.            |
| **(Optional)**                | Inform roster contacts depending on privacy policy.                           |

Would you like me to show how to implement **step 4** ‚Äî i.e., how each `bimipSignal` instance should suppress all awareness broadcasts once visibility is disabled?

```
request = %Bimip.AwarenessVisibility{
  id: "1",
  from: %Bimip.Identity{
    eid: "a@domain.com",
    connection_resource_id: "aaaaa1"
  },
  type: 1,  # 1 = ENABLED (means user wants to hide awareness)
  timestamp: System.system_time(:millisecond)
}

msg_request = %Bimip.MessageScheme{
  route: 4,  # Awareness route
  payload: {:awareness_visibility, request}
}

binary = Bimip.MessageScheme.encode(msg_request)
hex    = Base.encode16(binary, case: :upper)
```
